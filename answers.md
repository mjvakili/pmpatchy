Dear Editor,

We thank the referee for the thorough review of our work and for the constructive report that 
substantially improved the quality of the paper.

Please find below responses to the referee's comments for the submission.

Thank you, Mohammadjavad Vakili & Francico-Shu Kitaura (on behalf of the authors)

=================================
Reviewer's Comments:

>This paper extends the previous PATCHY code from the authors to include a Particle Mesh (PM) 
algorithm and a MCMC method to fit the halo (or galaxy) bias function from the mass field. 
The paper also provides fit parameters of a particular bias function, and claims that if 
performs better than other fast mock generators, although comparing only with one.

>I would need to see a moderate to major revision of the paper to accept if for publication.

>Main points:

>It seems to me that the main work done here has been integrating two previous public codes (FastPM and EMCEE) 
into the author's code PACHY. I think it needs to be explained how this has been done. 
A section of code integration would be appropriate here.

>While the title mention gravity solvers there is parctically no explanation on 
this a part from a reference of Feng et al. This being highlined in the abstract 
and conclusions by the authors it requires a considerable expansion; 
this could be done extending section 2 or a new section.

>It strikes me that the code HALOGEN (Avila et al. 1412.5228), 
when this code basically does the same job. I would require some 
sort of comparison of their performances, even at the level of results 
and not necessarily at the level of using the same Initial Conditions, although
that would be good too.

>All across the paper sentences like "accurate to k= some number" are given. 
These sentences should be complemente by mentining to what degree are 
they accurate lie accurate to X% to k=Y Mpc h^-1.


>Other relevant points:

>Maybe this is trivial, but what is the bivariate halo PDF, does it mean eq 3?

>Section 2.3: is there a reason why the likelihood should be evenly split between 
P(k) bit and rho(n)? What would prevent one to double the number of k bins and 
half the number of density bins? Would you expect the same result?

>Section 2.4: "COLA or FastPM computationally too expensive for massive production" 
of next generation of galaxy surveys. Please give details comparing with PATCHY.

>Summary:

>"major step" -- better "a move forward towards"

>"previous studies overestimate the contribution of the power due deviation of Poisson" 
-- are these the ALP powers? How clear is this that the reason is the Poisson undersestimation.

>"We have left the analysis of Redshift Space Distortions, as the 2p and 3p are 
more easily described in RSD". ---- This makes no sense. Did you leave the analysis 
for the future because it was more easily dscribed? I understand you don't need to do that, 
just mention it will be presented in future work.
